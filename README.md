# Week-1-Project
Week_1 Project for Christopher Rodriguez, Eric Sylvestre, and Hamilton White

This is a group project for Week 1 of Coding Temple bootcamp. My group worked on this project to practice collaborating with other developers in a team,
develop a better understanding of git version control and GitHub. Unfortunately, due to scheduling, every feature and QOL change was not able to be implemented
before the project needed to be turned in.
